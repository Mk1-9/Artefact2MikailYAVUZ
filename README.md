A simple package that allows to import very easily an UIView in SwiftUI.

Only 3 staps :

1) Import the package (if you're reading that it's already done)

2) Call an UIView like a SwiftUI view, example : MyUIView()

3) Add ".toSwiftUIView()" after MyUIView() = MyUIView().toSwiftUIView()

That's it.
